###### DL
DL part of ML where as NN is an architecture used in DL.
- Tree based Models
- Binary Classifiers
- Baysian approach
- NN - MLP, CNN

DL with
- Supervised learning(labelled data)
- Unsupervised learning(understanding something about dataset even if dont' have labels)
- SemiSupervised learning - what new data or decision to try to best learn how to accomplish a task

Math foundation for classification and regression Models
- How to formulate a decision based on mathematical computation, based on model co-efficients and weights.
    - how model can learn those co-efficients or weights using optimization and gradient descent
