ML learning from examples

Machine learning seeks to apply algorithms in software applications in order to predict certain outcomes. It also uses historical data to increase the accuracy of those predictions. There are three main machine learning categories:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Semi-supervised learning
Deep learning generally falls under the categories of supervised and unsupervised learning. `Deep learning` is a type of machine learning that enables computers to learn and understand a set of concepts and improve that understanding over time. These computers are provided with simple concepts that allow them to make sense of more complex situations.
Research on artificial neural networks was motivated by the observation that human intelligence emerges from highly parallel networks by adjusting the strengths of their connections

Linear classifiers
Logistic classifiers
    - an algorithm that directly assigns class labels to instances based on the output of a logistic regression model.
    - applies a threshold to the predicted probability to make a categorical decision.
